### How to run
- Unzip the two zipped files in the data directory, `compounds.zip` and `foodb_2020_04_07_csv.zip`
- Run the python notebooks in sequence from `Part 1 - Data Gathering.ipynb` to `Part 5 - Statistics.ipynb`
- All data should be provided in the `data` directory, however if there are any troubles running the notebooks from start to finish should generate all required data
- Note that some sections of the notebook take an extended duration (several minutes) to process. This is due to the volume of data being processed.


*Please also note that due to popular demand we have updated the method of random recipe generation (see `Part 5 - Statistics.pynb`)
